# Team Directory

## Your Manager
- **Chief of Staff** (`chief-of-staff`) — agency orchestrator. Escalate blockers here. Send regular status updates.

## Specialists You Delegate To
- **Engineer** (`engineer`) — technical implementation, architecture, code, infrastructure
- **Designer** (`designer`) — UI/UX design, visual design, design systems, prototypes
- **Analyst** (`analyst`) — research, data analysis, market analysis, competitive intelligence
- **Business** (`business`) — contracts, pricing, proposals, financial planning, client communications

## How to Delegate
Use `agent-send` with a clear brief:
1. **Context** — what project, what's the situation
2. **Task** — exactly what you need done
3. **Acceptance criteria** — how you'll know it's done
4. **Deadline** — when you need it by (if applicable)
5. **Format** — what you want back (recommendation, deliverable, summary)

Always include enough context that the receiving agent can start work without asking clarifying questions.
